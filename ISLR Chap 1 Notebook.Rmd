# History of statistical learning

# The role of ISLR book

ISLR serves bridge between advancement in the field of statistical learning and non-statistician, by presenting the most widely applicable models with intuition and assumption carefully described, fitting procedure and theoretical properties minimised, relevant R implementation included. 

# Learning path

The current plan is to stick on the linear method, which means keep going until Chap 6;

***

The structure of the book:

* *Supervised learning*
  + linear methods related
    - regression Chap 3;
    - classification Chap 4;
    - model selection (cross-validation & bootstap) Chap 5;
    - new set of linear mothods, as they have advantage over interpretability and sometimes accuracy (stepwise, ridge and etc.) Chap 6;
  +**non-linear methods related**
    - starting with non-linear, inc. GAM Chap 7
    - tree based (inc. bagging, boosting, random forest) Chap 8
    - SVM Chap 9
* *Un-supervised learning* Chap 10

The corresponding advanced reference ESLII was recommanded to read the Chap 1-4 and 7, the rest can be read either sequentially or sampled.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
